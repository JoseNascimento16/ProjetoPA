Login to your gmail
Go to Security setting and Enable 2 factor authentication
After enabling this you can see app passwords option. Click here( https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords )
And then, from Your app passwords tab select Other option and put your app name and click GENERATE button to get new app password.
Finally copy the 16 digit of password and click done. 
Now use this password instead of email password to send mail via your app.
Now you can use just email and this generated pass to send email.
